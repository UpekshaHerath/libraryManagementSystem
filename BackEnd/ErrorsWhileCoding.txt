While coding this project I changed my nodejs version 
to the newest version. Up to that my project worked fine 
and after that nodejs version update it didn't worked due to a 
mongodb database error. 
I fixed that by replacing the database url to;
    mongodb://localhost/libraryManagementSystem2
    to : mongodb://127.0.0.1/libraryManagementSystem2
